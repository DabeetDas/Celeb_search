# Celeb Search

## Overview
Celeb Search is a project that develops a machine learning model to recognize images of five popular celebrities: Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Cruise, and Megan Fox. The aim was to create an effective solution for classifying celebrity images, balancing accuracy with a simple, efficient model.

## Project Highlights
- **Objective:** Build a model to classify celebrity images with high accuracy.
- **Approach:** Used a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Data:** Images were curated from Kaggle and preprocessed to ensure consistency.
- **Outcome:** Achieved a high classification accuracy (95%) while mitigating overfitting through careful model tuning.

## Why This Project?
This project showcases the practical challenges of machine learning, including data preparation, model design, and performance optimization. It illustrates the real-world process of developing an AI solution from concept to implementation.
